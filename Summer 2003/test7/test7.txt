1. Overview

        I would like to thank everyone for being here. We have a lot to
discuss and a lot of ground to cover in this first meeting. Unfortunately,
do to the nature of this first meeting we will not have a lot of time for
conversation or ideas to be presented back to me. However, I want you to take
notes and if you need to come talk to me offline. This will allow me to help
clarify any questions you may have. Also, minutes will be taken and an email
will be sent to each of you outlining what was in this meeting.
        Some of the things that we are going to discuss is what we need to do
to clarify the mission an goals of our site. How we can balance the needs of
our customers and schools administration. We will be covering what content
and functionality the site will have and specify how users will be able to
interact with that site. It is key to note that users to not necessarily
think the way we do in the information technology or computer software and
development areas and how we would organize our information is very much
different from the layman who barely knows how to turn on a PC let alone
how to program one. We will need to map out our entire site and make sure
that it will be able to expand and accommodate this growth with ease. Though
it is listed last, it is important to note that our design of organization,
indexing, labeling, and navigations systems are critical. We will also need
to keep in mind how users will browse information and what support we will
need to offer to the users to help them have a positive experience here on
this site. Keep in mind that this is our first meeting, so take notes and
please collate any ideas you may have and bring them with you to the next
meeting this coming Tuesday.

2. Goals and Audience

      First we need to understand the big picture or our current goals for
organizing this site. The reason that we are rewriting the BYU-I web site is
due to a couple of factors. First, the site has become disorganized and needs
to be cleaned up. Second, we need to formulate a new standard that can apply
to all pages on the web making the web experience better that it has been.
        Our starting targets for who we are developing the new BYU-I site will
first focus on students, second on teachers, and lastly on faculty. These will
be our main focus goals. Some other individuals that we will need to focus on
are those who are casually browsing for schools, anyone willing to donate to
the school, and give credit to these individuals. Another main point that we
need to keep in mind is that as we are going through this development process
we need you to keep in mind any other target groups that we need to be aware
of and make note of them on our next review.
        As we begin this first faze of development I want to impress some of
the main reasons individuals will be coming to our site, which will be listed
in no particular order.
1. Signing up for classes 
2. Registering for school
3. See posted grades
4. Get current school events.
5. School catalog
6. Searching for student or teacher contact information.
7. Online learning
        These key areas also require certain functionality which will need to
be addressed. Some of the other functional items that will need to be
addressed are.
1. Registering for classes
2. Registering for school
3. Financial aid
4. Optional settings for how much personal information is displayed on the
   web.
5. Browsing the online school catalog of courses.
6. Security concerns.
        With the redevelopment of the BYU-I web site we will need to take into
consideration what kind of information is posted and presented to the user.
These items should include at minimum the following.
1. School catalog
2. Student information
3. Employee information
4. School registration
5. Teacher / Student schedules
6. School events
7. Brief history of the school and church. 
        We need to keep in mind that our main goal is to provide a portal for
students and teachers to communicate and to assist students with their career
goals, to aid students in gaining knowledge of career goals and to assist
teachers in providing feedback to students.

3. Success Measurements

        As we are developing this site we will need weekly updates as to your
progress so that we will be able to evaluate weather we are moving in the
correct direction. Management is concerned about how much the rewrite of the
site is going to cost and wants a projected estimate for how long it will
take and the approximate costs. If these things are with in budget we will
begin full on development of the new site.
        Two of our goals for this site include improving customer service
and site performance. To verify that we are meeting these goals, we will need
to take a personal survey of our site every three months beginning with our
first evaluation of the current site and any possible improvements that maybe
needed. It is very possible that on our first pass will find that we are
missing several of our needed target audiences and we will need to make
adjustments to include them in the overall project schema.

4. Content Definition

      I have mentioned this briefly before but, as we continue through the
development process for this web we need to keep in mind any ideas that come
to us during the information gathering process and even during the actual
development of the site. These brief spurts of genius need to be written
down or else they will be forgotten. At the end of each week, I would like to
see the notes collated and brought to our weekly meetings every Tuesday. This
will prove invaluable as we asses our direction and focus. It will provide a
means for organizing our information on the web as well as providing
excellent ideas to be discussed during our meetings. This will help the
overall team synergize and be productive in our efforts to improve the
current web site.
      At the end of each meeting on Tuesday the meeting minuets will be
recorded along with where our progress is currently in design and
implementation and any notes or other visual information will be digitally
photographed and emailed to each of you to aid in the current development
process. If during the week you have anything to discuss with me, youre more
then welcome to come by my office and discuss with me your ideas offline.
I encourage each of you to come and talk with me if you have any ideas or
thoughts that you need to bounce off someone.

5. Information Organization

        One of our main challenges is dealing with how information is
organized and being presented to our users. Unfortunately, we are currently
dealing with level of ambiguity and of differing perspectives as to how one
is to get to the information available on the current site. Another issue is
the great deal of diverse information that is heterogeneous in nature. We
have a wide variety of topics available for study and each group having its
own agenda and ideas on how it is to be presented. This leads to internal and
political issues as to whom and what is most important. In order to help keep
these problems to a minimum, I need each of you to keep in mind that as you
deal with these groups to help educate them as to what our main focus and
goals are. This needs to be done in a tactful and careful manner, as to not
invalidate their position or feelings. If anything take note of their ideas
and let them know that we will take into consideration all ideas. But let them
know that our main focus and goals must be met.
        Continuing with our organization issues, our web site will need to
cover thee basic organizational schemes, that of Alphabetical, Chronological
and Geographical listings. This is going to make development of the site
difficult as we will have overlapping schemes for finding information on
our site. Careful consideration will be mandatory of each of these areas
as well as any other ambiguous organization structures available for
presenting to the user a concise and easy listing of the desired information.

6. Usability Testing

        This being our first meeting on the redesigning of the BYU-I web
site, we will need to keep in mind some future discussions and testing
implementations. After our first design session I want each team to take the
parts that they are designing in detail and test them thoroughly. It is
important to note that I do not want anyone to lay one stitch of code for
your first draft until after at least the first two meetings have been
completed. Listed below is the testing process that will be followed as
we reevaluate the site every three months.
1. Heuristic evaluations
2. Testing with pencil and paper
3. Testing a simple navigational interface
4. Testing a structural prototype
5. Testing a complex navigational interface
6. Full-blown beta testing
Keep in mind if we follow this process, we will save time and money in the
development of the new site.

7. Navigation Systems

        Now that we have covered several of the high level issues, we are now
going to delve into some of the lower level issues one of them being
Navigation. All of you are hopefully familiar with the current navigation
system on the site. It is extremely flexible and has lead to some problems
in helping uses get from one place to the next. We need to keep these menu
systems down to a minimum so as to keep from overwhelming the user. Because
we have so many different departments all seeking to be noticed we will need
to formulate three out of the four basic types of navigation.
1. Hierarchical Navigation
2. Global Navigation
3. Local Navigation
        The way that this will work is that all sites will be under the
main BYU-I web site and can be reached from a global directory listing. With
in each group will be its own local navigation which will be dictated by our
style guide. I want to try and avoid as much ad hock navigation as possible.
It is important to note that this is similar to the current site design and I
am open to suggestions as to how to improve this schema.
        Another design aspect that we will maintain from the previous site is
the Navigation bars and pull-down menus. However, I want to see these used
sparingly and to make them functional behavior the same for each element and
page.
        Lastly, we will need three other areas for helping students, teachers,
and any other visitors get around our site. They are.
1. Table of contents
2. Index
3. Site map

8. Labeling Systems

        As we develop our navigational scheme, we also need to be aware of
labeling systems that can be implemented. People do not have long attention
spans, and if we do not present to the use the key information we will loose
them. Second, if we do not have a proper standard it is very likely that we
will make a poor impression on those who are visiting the site. Especially if
one area has good labeling and another area does not. It will show that we
cannot be consistent. It is better that we have a poor labeling system that
is consistent then to have good and bad mixed in with our defining system.
It is also key to note that we are not trying to set labels on things but
to be able to group items in a manner that is readable and understandable
for the user.
        Listed below are a few labeling types that can be used and where.
1. Labels within navigation systems
2. Labels as indexing terms
3. Link labels
4. Labels as headings
5. Iconic labeling systems
        As we are interested in correctly labeling our content we need to keep
in mind where we can find correct labels that will be informative and help us
identify information for our user base. First I want you all to consider the
current labels already in place. Then go out to the web and look for what
other people have suggested as good labels. Keep words simple if possible
and their definitions concise. Also look to what other users or experts are
saying.
        Once we have gathered these labels we will take them and go over them
one by one and figure out how to best place them and fine tune their scope
and size

9. Searching Systems

      Do to known time and money constraints we will not be implementing a
search engine. The current system works well. We will continue to use
Google as the power for searching our site. However, what we will do is to
use the search engines APIs so that we can provide a look and feel that is
our own instead of Googles. What we need to keep in mind is that Google will
not always be up-to-date, so we will need to list on our highest trafficked
pages is to inform the search engine to come back frequently to keep the
information current. This will allow us to cater to each style of user
searching for information on our site, from casual browsers to those doing
a comprehensive search.
      Another advantage to using Googles search engine is that most people
are already familiar on how it works. This will reduce education time in
helping people know how to search our site. Because we will be using Google,
all of our information will be indexed but it may not be indexed 100% way we
expect it to be. We will need to keep this in mind as we develop each page
and appropriately list meta tags to help in the searching criteria that
is made when using Google.
